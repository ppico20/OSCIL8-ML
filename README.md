# OSCIL8-ML: explainable predictions of gravity-capillary interfacial waves

## Overview
This project provides a framework to predict the behaviour of interfacial oscillations driven by gravity and surface tension based on their properties. We provide various scripts that leverage ensemble (XGBoost, Random Forest) and deep (MLP) learning methods to predict interface location, interfacial area, kinetic energy, and interfacial velocity based on only a few dimensionless numbers characterising the system (Bond and Laplace numbers, density and viscosity ratios, and amplitude of initial perturbation). We also use dimensionality reduction techniques to to forecast the systemâ€™s evolution through image prediction. With this framework, we are able to obtain temporal images of interface motion.
